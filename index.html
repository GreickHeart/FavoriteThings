    <p> Most people are quick to dismiss hyenas. They aren't as majestic looking as lions or as impressive as elephants. But they are fearsome predators.</p>

    <ul>
    <li> Hyena's have a bite force of 1,100 psi, much stronger than Lions or Tigers. Those jaws are perfect for crunching through bone.</li>
    <li> Hyena's are more closely related to cats than dogs!</li>
    <li> The Spotted Hyena can run at 37mph. </li>
    </ul>
